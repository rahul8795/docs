Introduction:
-------------
Enterprise: It is a Business organization or collection of organizations runnig a single
            label.
Enterprise Application: It is a software applicaiton designed for an enterprise to  
simplify the internal Business processing.

To prepare enterprise applicaitons, we have to provide the following three layer.
1. Presentation Layer or user interface layer
--> To improve look and feel to the enterprise appl
--> It is starting point to the appl inorder to access
--> To take data from users and to submit data to appl
--> To perform client side data validations with javascript functions
--> To submit defferent types of requests from client to server Ex. POST, GET, HEAD,....
--> Presentation Logic
--> AWT, SWING, HTML, JSP, Free Marker, Velocity,.....


2. Business processing layer or business layer
--> It is heart of the enterprise application.
--> To define and execute the business rules and regulations which are req by the clients exactly
--> Business Logic
--> Servlet, JSP[Rarely], EJB-Session Beans,...

3. Data layer or Data Storage and access layer or persistence layer
--> To interact with Database and to achieve data persistency
--> Persistence Logic
--> JDBC, EJBs-Entity Beans, JPA, DAOs.....


Hibernate -----> Persistence Layer
Struts, JSF ---> Presentaion Layer
Spring ------> All the enterprise appl layers.

Data Persistency:
------------------
Representing data permanently in back end systems is called as data persistency.

Data persistency Operations: To make data persistency if we perform operations with Back
END Systems then that Operations are called as Data persistence operations.
Ex. CRUD
C ---> Create / Inserting Data
R ---> Read / Retrieve
U ---> Update
D ---> Delete

Data Persistence Tech: To achieve data persistency,if we use any tech then it is called
as Data persistence Tech
EX. JDBC, Hibernate, JPA, EJB-Entity Beans..........

In enterprise applicaitons, to perform data persistency, we will use the following tech
w.r.t JAVa:

1. Serialization and Deserialization
2. JDBC
3. ORM
   1. EJBs Entity Beans
   2. Hibernate
   3. JPA
   4. Open JPA
   5. Toplink
   6. iBatis
      ------

1. Serialization and Deserialization:
-------------------------------------
The process of seperating data from an object and storing that data in a flat file is 
called as Serialization.

The process of Regenerating an object on the basis of data is called as Deserialization.

1. ObjectOutputStream ---> For Serialization
2. ObjectInputStream ----> For Deserialization

FileOutputStream
FileInputStream  


2. Data Persistency through JDBC:
----------------------------------
--> JDBC is a step by step process or a Tech or an API, it will provide very good env
to interact with databases from Java applications inorder to perform database operations
from java applications.

--> JDBC is an abstraction[Colleciton of interface] provided by SUN Microsystems and 
implemented by all the database vendors.

--> In JDBC applications, we need driver, It will map Java API representaions to SQL
API representations.

Oracle:
Driver Class: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
Driver URL: jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe

MySQL:
Driver Class: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver[MySQL5.7 versions]
              com.mysql.jdbc.Driver[Upto MySQL5.5 version]
Driver URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_Name

Steps tp prepare JDBC Applications:
1. Load and register driver
2. Establish connection between java applicaiton and database.
3. Create either Statement or PreaparedStatement or CallableStatement
4. Write and execute SQL queries
5. Close the resources

Requirement of ORM:
--------------------
ORM is providing mapping between object oriented data model elemetns to relational data
model elemetns either through XML document or through annotaitons

Class --------> Table
Object -------> Record
ID prop ------> OK Column
Normal prop---> Normal Column

Mismatiches between Object Oriented data model and relational data model:
1. Granualarity Mismatch
2. Sub types mismatch
3. Associations Mismatch
4. Identity Mismatch
5. Cost mismatch
   ---------
   ---------

1. Granualarity Mismatch:
------------------------

2. Sub types mismatch:
----------------------
3. Associations Mismatch:
-------------------------
1. One-To-One Association
2. One-To-Many Association
3. Many-To-One Association
4. Many-To-Many Association

By declaring one class reference variable in another class is assocoation.

class Employee{
   String eid;
   String ename;
   String esal;
   String eaddr;
   Account acc;
}

class Account{
   String accNo;
   String accName;
   String accType;
   ----
}

4. Identity Mismatch:
---------------------
